Feature: Pointer full input
  In order be able to do things like multiple file uploads
  As a User
  I want a full input view on pointers.

#Scenario: creating a pointer with full input
#   Given I log in as Joe User
#   And I create Basic card "phone+*options" with content "{"type":"Phrase"}"
#   And I create Pointer card "phone+*rform"
#   And I create Phrase card "phone+*input" with content "full"
#   And I create Phrase card "phone+*autoname" with content "1"
#   When I go to card "Joe User+phone"
#   And I fill in cards_joe_user_plus_phone_plus_1_content with "is you is"
#   And I follow (the add new one link)
#   And I fill in cards_joe_user_plus_phone_plus_1_content with "is you aint"
#   And I press "Submit" "Create"
#   And I go to card "Joe User+phone"
#   Then I should see "is you is"
#   And I should see "is you aint"
