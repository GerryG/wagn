=Wagn: how pioneers roll

==READ ME FIRST!

This gem is brand new and is EXPERIMENTAL. If you're curious to play around, feel free! But if you want to host a production site, try the documentation at http://wagn.org/get_started

==Basics

Wagn is an open web platform for building coherent web systems.

Using simple wiki-inspired building blocks called cards, "Wagneers" construct sites ranging from simple content managers to custom project trackers to fully integrated web suites.  

==Dependencies
 
Ruby[http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/]:: version 1.8.7 or higher
Bundler[http://gembundler.com/]:: version 1.0 or higher
ImageMagick[http://www.imagemagick.org/]::
A database engine:: Either MySQL[http://www.mysql.com/] or PostgreSQL[http://www.postgresql.org/]

Platform-specific details at: http://www.wagn.org/wagn/installation_1_8+Platform_Notes

 
=Installation

===1. install the gem

 gem install wagn

Watch carefully for errors!


===2. create a new wagn application

  wagn new mysite


===3. create / seed database

Edit the config/database.yml file as necessary. More about database configuration at http://www.wagn.org/database_configuration.

Then run

  cd mysite
  rake wagn:create
  
..to create and seed the database


===4. start your server

To fire up the default, built-in WEBrick server, just run:

  wagn server
 
...and point your browser to http://localhost:3000 (unless otherwise configured).

WEBrick is great for a quick test run.  To run a production website, see http://www.wagn.org/wagn_in_production.
