    #   The external api with checks:
    #     render(:viewname, args)
    #
    #   Roughly equivalent to:
    #     render_viewname(args)
    #
    #   The internal call that skips the checks:
    #     _render_viewname(args)
    #
    #   Each of the above ultimately calls:
    #     _final(_set_key)_viewname(args)

    #                set_callback object_method, kind, event, :prepend=>true

    #              end
    #            end

    # ... and then handled in #include_set_modules like so:
    #
    #   singleton_class.send :include, m

    #    if m.respond_to? :callbacks
    #      m.callbacks.each do |object_method, kind, event|
    #        singleton_class.set_callback object_method, kind, event, :prepend=>true
    #      end
    #    end

    #  it may have been more appropriate to add the callbacks elsewhere, but point is current moot, as the callback definitions were screwing with the Card class.
    #  I may have been doing something wrong, but it seemed like the callback class attributes were handling things fine, but the runner methods were getting
    #  inappropriately update on the Card class itself.  This wasn't super easy to debug, and the current solution occurred to me in the process, but I wanted to
    #  document the alternative here in case we decide that's ultimately cleaner and more appropriate.
